# Idea behind the app

## Authentication

This app will allow users to register with their mobile number; email and password ; with Google; or with Github. Only logging in with email would require a user to enter their password.For mobile number , an OTP would be sent to the user for authenticating.

After registering with email users would have to confirm it.

Users who have registerd with an email id would later have an option for adding a phone number, not used before, and after verifying they can be searched by that.

Same goes for users who registerd with Github and Google.

And for users who registerd with phone number, a ,not-used in our app email, can be added.4

	2FA
Usrs who have'nt signed up with phone number , can either  add a phone number where they'd be sent an OTP or enable 2FA on the email itself.

For Phone number ones  // Aprameya , bro I can't decide what to do with em decide yourslef.


## Adding users

Users can be searched by their phone numbers , email Ids or both  (Only if they've added both).
For the first time, approvel of the added person would be required.

(Here comes my bussiness-y mind)

For premium version users can disable if they could be searched by their phone numbers.
(Or maybe give it for free) 

Disabling search by email id would be provided free.
